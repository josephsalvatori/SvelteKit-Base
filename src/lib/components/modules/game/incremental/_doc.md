# The Tower
A text adventure / incremental game about scaling a wizard's tower full of weird, otherworldly magic and dark, Raimi-esque humor.

## Details
The player is an oozemancer that cannot remember their magic or objective, and during their climb up the tower, will be able to dispel the enchantments blocking their skills and find clues to why they're here.

The tower is locked down, almost like it is sealed and prepared for your arrival.

You wake up on a cold stone floor
